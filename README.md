# This repository contains the dataset I used in my analysis as well as the Jupyter Notebook I used to write up my python code:
``` analysis.ipynb ```

## The questions I examine in my analysis are the following:
**1.** Which team has scored the most goals in the past decade?
**2.** Which team have had the most home wins vs. away wins?
**3.** Is there a correlation between the number of shots taken by a team and the number of goals they score?
**4.** Has fouling become more frequent over the years and what can one conclude from the findings?
**5.** What factors impact a teams ability to win the most?

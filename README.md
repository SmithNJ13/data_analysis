# This repository contains the dataset I used in my analysis as well as the Jupyter Notebook I used to write up my python code:
``` analysis.ipynb ```

## The questions I examine in my analysis are the following:

**1.** Which team has scored the most goals in the past decade?
```Man City, Total Goals: 956```

**2.** Which team(s) in the past decade, win most of their games at home and which team(s) win most of their games away?
```
Interestingly, the team with the highest home win rate % is Middlesbrough with 80.0% of their wins at home.
Ipswich have the highest away win rate % at 67.0%.
Ironically, despite these impressive values, both teams have their overall win rate % at 13.0%. Yikes.
```


**3.** Is there a correlation between the number of shots taken by a team and the number of goals they score?  

**4.** Has fouling become more frequent over the years and what can one conclude from the findings?  

**5.** What factors impact a team's ability to win the most?
